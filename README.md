font-icons
==========

Here are a number of font icons generated that are free for all to use.  Ideally, I would love to see these one day included in some of the great projects such as @fontawesome,  But ultimately that's for them to decide.  Feel free to use any of the icons in the repo.

I use fontello for generating the font files from the svg files.  They done a fantastic job letting you generate your own webfonts from a number of different fonts around the community.
